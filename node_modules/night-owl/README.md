Night Owl is a simple, elegant and fast static site generator for node.js.

Night Owl has a long list of features --- file-based
routing, custom URLs, front-matter, tagging and collections, sorting, paginated
indexes, nested layouts, multi-page templates, custom compilers, file watching,
a local development server, live reloads, ECMAScript module imports, and more.

Support for a number of different template formats is also included. Generate
HTML pages from Markdown, Pug, Handlebars, JavaScript, JSON and YAML. Use the
built-in CSS, Sass, JavaScript and Typescript compilers to bundle files ready
for the browser.

```cli
npm install night-owl
```

## Is this ready to use?

Night Owl is still a work in progress. Although most features are now
implemented and the API is relatively stable, some bugs can still be expected.
Minor versions may include breaking changes before reaching a stable v1.0.0.

## Why not use another tool?

The driving purpose behind Night Owl is to provide a fast tool to develop static
sites, with a focus on the Pug templating language. Pug's minimalist syntax
comes at the cost of slow template compilation. Where some static site
generators recompile templates every time any file changes, Night Owl waits for
a specific template (or its dependencies) to change.

Night Owl also provides support for bundling client-side CSS and JavaScript
without any extra configuration. Modern tools often force you to buy in
to a complex and often unnecessary framework. Others require you to roll your
own Rollup or Webpack configuration in addition to setting up your site.

Night Owl aims to to strike the right balance between flexibility and
simplicity, providing enough to get you started without getting in the way.
